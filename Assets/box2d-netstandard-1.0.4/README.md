# Box2D .NET Standard 

Box2D .NET Standard is the port of Box2D from C++ to C# by Ben Ukhanov 2020.

Loosely based on Box2DX by Ihar Kalasouski 2008.

- The purpose of this repository is to create Box2D .NET Standard library.
- The .NET Standard supports .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5.0.
- The NuGet package is available on [Box2D.NetStandard](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Box2D.NetStandard/).

## Features

### Collision

- Continuous collision detection.
- Contact callbacks: add, persist, remove.
- Convex polygons and circles.
- Multiple shapes per body.
- One-shot contact manifolds.
- Incremental sweep-and-prune broadphase.
- Efficient pair management.
- Fast broadphase AABB queries.
- Collision groups and categories.

### Physics

- Continuous physics with time of impact solver.
- Persistent body-joint-contact graph.
- Island solution and sleep management.
- Contact, friction, and restitution.
- Stable stacking with a linear-time solver.
- Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, and mouse joints.
- BJoint limits, motors, and friction.
- Momentum decoupled position correction.
- Fairly accurate reaction forces/impulses.

### System

- Centralized tuning parameters.
- Pure .NET Standard 2.0+ library.
- Please [See .NET Implementation Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).
